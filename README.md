# Bicycle Purchase Application

## Overview

This project is a software application designed to facilitate the selection and purchase of bicycles and related accessories. The application enables customers to choose a bicycle type, frame type, and brake type, which are then used to calculate and display the total price. Additionally, customers can select various accessories, which are also added to the total price. The application includes functionality to validate customer information, such as name, address, town, postcode, and card number, ensuring all required fields are correctly filled out. Once the customer completes their selections and enters their information, the software generates a receipt that includes all the selected options and the total cost. The project also includes a comprehensive test log to ensure all functionalities are working correctly, from calculating totals based on selections to validating inputs and generating receipts.
